Although we think everything is fine and keep continuing on with our daily lives, but it is really not. Trees are our source of oxygen, which allows us to breathe, but every day, thousands of trees are cut down. This makes a widespread effect across forests and other biomes filled with trees. As a result of cutting down trees, oxygen sources may not be availble. Due to this, many companies now rise to bring trees back to the Earth to make it how it always was. If you want to help their cause, consider donating to them, usually it is only one dollar to plant a tree! Also, you might be able to learn how to garden by planting multiple trees, making a new hobby while also helping the world. Especially at a time like now, the Earth needs your help, and don't be afraid to speak up. Every bit counts!</p>

But what are robots? Are they magical creatures that came from the sky? Actually, they are built by mankind! Over the century, we have made drastic changes and improvements in them. Some can even display feelings to people! Things like the phone, computer, and tablet were all made by us and we can use it to our advantage. They are things that make our day to day life easy. Recently, engineers have been making robots that have the same body shape as humans, like the one you see near the text. Robots are great, and they are one of our most prodigious scientific achievements ever!</p>
